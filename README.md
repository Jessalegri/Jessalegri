### Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate developer focused on frontend, skilled in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

I manage development environments with Linux and Docker, and build applications using Node.js and MySQL. Currently, I'm enhancing public transportation in Nicaragua and collaborating with Universus, innovating with artificial intelligence solutions.
